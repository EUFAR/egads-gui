Project Overview:
EGADS GUI is a Python-based graphical user interface dedicated to EGADS. The project is still in early development and is not intended to be used in a production environment. But it can be tested if a user wants to have an overview of the possibilities. 

Few functions are available through the GUI:
   - read/write NetCDF files
   - read/write NASA/Ames files
   - conversion between different file format
   - use of algorithms
   - creation of new algorithms
   - display/plot/print data

Next functions (to be done):
   - work on a batch of files
   - light operations during plot (compute trend, standard deviation, mean, ...)

Prerequisites:
   - EGADS (0.8.8+) and its dependencies have to be installed

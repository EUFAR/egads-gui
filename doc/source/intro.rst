Introduction
=============

The EGADS (EUFAR General Airborne Data-processing Software) core is a Python-based library of processing and file I/O routines designed to help analyze a wide range of airborne atmospheric science data. EGADS purpose is to provide a benchmark for airborne data-processing through its community-provided algorithms, and to act as a reference by providing guidance to researchers with an open-source design and well-documented processing routines.

The GUI (Graphical User Interface) developed for EGADS is a program based on Python and PyQt5 and designed to process/display/plot airborne atmospheric science data. The GUI purpose is to facilitate the use of EGADS for newcomers and to allow the display of data quickly with few clicks.

Python 2.7 is used in development of EGADS due to its compatibility with old libraries (CEDA Nappy). A version based on Python 3.x is explored and will be available once all libraries are compatible with Python 3.x. PyQt5 has been finally chosen as a basis for its compatibility with other software, in particular Matplotlib 2.x.


.. NOTE::
  EGADS GUI is still in beta state and will require a certain knowledge in Python if corrections must be made as quicly as possible.

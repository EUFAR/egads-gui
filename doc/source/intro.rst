Introduction

The EGADS (EUFAR General Airborne Data-processing Software) core is a Python-based library of processing and file I/O routines designed to help analyze a wide range of airborne atmospheric science data. EGADS purpose is to provide a benchmark for airborne data-processing through its community-provided algorithms, and to act as a reference by providing guidance to researchers with an open-source design and well-documented processing routines.

The GUI (Graphical User Interface) developed for EGADS is a program based on Python and PyQt5 and designed to process/display/plot airborne atmospheric science data. The GUI purpose is to facilitate the use of EGADS for newcomers and to allow the display of data quickly with few clicks.

As the EUFAR FP7 project ended the 31st of January 2018, the development of EGADS GUI has been stopped for now. To continue to improve EGADS GUI outside the scope of EUFAR, a new branch has been created: EGADS Lineage GUI. EGADS Lineage GUI is still EGADS GUI, but compatible with Python 3 and maintained by Olivier Henry. All issues reported in EGADS GUI and EGADS Lineage GUI will be fixed in EGADS Lineage GUI only. A merging of both project will probably happen in the next EUFAR project.

.. NOTE::
  From now on, EGADS GUI will refer to EGADS Lineage GUI.

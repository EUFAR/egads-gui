CHANGELOG
=========

To do in the next version:
==========================
  - rewrite the logging system
  - rework the metadata windows to handle properly NASA Ames files
  - allow the simple save of a NASA Ames file


June 13 2017, Release version 0.9.0
====================================
  Following the release of EGADS 0.8.0, the GUI has been reworked to add improvements and make it compatible. Actually for deadlines reasons, the GUI function to read NASA Ames files is not fully ready: it's still possible to read NASA Ames files, and export them to a new NetCDF or NASA Ames file, but its not possible to simply save the opened NASA Ames file (the user has to "Save As ..." to save modifications brought to a NASA Ames file and with a different name). Also, the handling of metadata has not been totally converted to handle metadata in NASA Ames files. It should be ready in the next minor version.
  PyQt4 has been replaced by PyQt5 to improve compatibility with few scientific modules. It is now possible to create algorithms from the GUI.
  
  MODIFIED:
    - the main window has been modified to decrease memory and cpu footprints.
    - the global attributes window has been modified to decrease memory and cpu footprints.
    - the variable attributes window has been modified to decrease memory and cpu footprints.
    - the object in which are stored all data and metadata has been changed from a list to a dictionnary.
    - all functions to handle the data object has been modified to comply with the new object type.
    - plot options are now applied to subplot(s).
    - a new way to list all embedded algorithms has been introduced.
    - user-created algorithms are now listed into EGADS GUI with embedded algorithms.
    - as the "Quantities" module doesn't allow to change units of a variable, the possibility to modify units in EGADS GUI has been disabled.
    
  FIXED:
    - when multiple plots are created, all the radio buttons belong to the same group.
    - when chosen, the marker line style wasn't applied to the plot.
    - if a time series is deleted in the 'single plot' part, and if it's the last one, the figure options are not deleted.
    - if a time series is deleted in the 'single plot' part, and if there are still other time series left, the name of the time series is not deleted from the legend.
    - if a subplot is deleted without being drawn, an error appears when trying to remove subplot options which don't exist.
    - properties of the legend are not the same if the 'Update' button is pushed in the plot options section or in the figure options section.
    - after creating two or more subplots, if the first one is deleted, unique options are deleted as well, and it's leading to a crash.
    - after creating two or more subplots, if subplots are not drawn from the 1st one to the last one, it will leads to issues in plot options. Now the user have to draw a subplot before adding another.
    - if multiple plots or subplots are created, deleted and created agains, all checkboxes belong to the same group.
    - the saving of an image was leading to a crash. It has been fixed.
    - if multiple subplots are created, and one of them is drawn, the deletion of one of the empty ones lead to a crash.
    - if multiple subplots are created, the size of the first one legend is not well defined.
    - an object was missing in the algorithm generator.
    - the metadata 'standard_name' wasn't registered succesfully once a variable is created by an algorithm.
    - output metadata during algorithm creation are now well formated.
    - global and variable attributes are now sorted if displayed in the 'attributes' window.
    - in the plot window, variables are now sorted in the different comboboxes.
    - all toolbuttons weren't well disconnected when a file was closed and the GUI cleared.
    - the text of the QLineEdin the data Display Window is now black.
    - if multiple subplots are created and one or more are deleted, 'spines' option for all other subplots is set on fully visible.
    - all new items in Processings menu have now the same style than other menu items.
    - items in Processings menu weren't well sorted.
    - variable list in the variable tab is now sorted by default.
    - fixed an issue with the function to list all algorithms: all folders were added twice.
    - fixed an issue during the validation of units if an algorithm is created via the gui.
    
  ADDED:
    - a new window to create algorithm is now available.
    - a new window is now available to confirm (or not) the success of the algorithm creation.
    - all algorithms are now listed in the menu bar under 'Processings'. If user click on one algorithm, a window with algorithm information should open.
    - 'Variable attributes' has been added to the Variable attributes window.
    - an icon has been added to the plot window.
    - in the plot window, if the pan or the zoom function is activated, the user will have to release it to modify or update the plot window.
    - a splashscreen has been added with a EUFAR logo.
    - a function to validate units has been added in the algorithm creation window.
    - warning messages have been added if a user try to close a file or quit EGADS GUI and a file is already opened and modified.
    - an information message has been added to inform that a variable can't be deleted from a netcdf file.
    

December 1 2016, Release version 0.8.1

September 1 2016, Release version 0.8.0
=======================================
  Matplotlib package is used to generate all figures. A logging system has been introduced.
  As more bugs have been found in Nappy and to prevent future compatibility issues, a new function to read and write NASA Ames format will be coded.
  
  ADDED:
    - a simple function to plot data has been introduced.
    - a new plot window with custom icons has been designed. It has been connected to the official Matplotlib API.

    - a new window has been added to display information about EGADS.
    - plot options have been expanded to include subplots.

  FIXED:
    - EGADS core couldn't process correctly variable units if the unit is 'unicode' and not 'str'.
    - EGADS core couldn't process correclty time units if the unit is composed of 'time' (seconds, minutes, hours, ...) and ' since xxxxx'.
    - as the netcdf gui function changed, the closing function wasn't cleaning the GUI properly.
    - fixed a bug with set_linestyle, markers weren't displayed correctly
    - the deletion of two or more variables brings a TypeError. It has been fixed
    - during the creation of a new variable through the process window, the dimensions of the new variable wasn't set correctly. It has been fixed
    - once a new variable is created and selected in the new variables tab, the icon to migrate the variable is not enabled. It has been fixed
    - if a new variable is created with a list as Category metadata, the variable couldn't be saved. It has been fixed.
    - if multiple time series are displayed in the same plot window, clearing the window bring an error and doesn't clean all options, this has been fixed.


February 16 2016, Release version 0.7.0
=======================================
  As Nappy, a module for python, called CDMS2, is incompatible with Window for now. A test with Pyinstaller for Linux is a success. A solution will be found for Windows.
  
  FIXED:
    - in the variable metadata window, if "show other attributes" is clicked two times (to show and to hide), once Save is clicked, the program crashes. It has been fixed.
    - a temporary solution has been found to allow Quantities module to correctly read CF1.0 time unit format. The modification has been introduced in "egads_core.py"
    
  ADDED:
    - a function to delete a variable has been introduced.
    - a function to apply an algorithm (just one) has been introduced to prepare the introduction of new variables. Applying an algorithm create a new workspace to store new variables.
    - a function to migrate new varibles to the main workspace.
    - a new window to allow processing operations has been introduced.
    - new metadata have been added to all algorithms : input type (vector, scalar, time, ...), input description, output description, purpose and description. Those modifications have been made to allow a user to know all caracteritics of an algorithm.
    - info boxes have been added to the processing window.
    - the number of input and output object in the processing window depends now on the metadata of the algorithm.
    - information about the selected algorithm are displayed in the processing window
    - the processing window can now handle multiple coefficients for one LineEdit.
    - in the processing window, the "Save" button will be available only if all fields have been filled in. Optionnal fields are not taken into account to activate the "Save" button.
    - a function and a window to display a variable has been introduced.
    - the processing window is now linked with the "new variable" tab and functional.
    - algorithms with multiple outputs are now managed by the processing window.

    - the gui can handle modification/deletion/addition of metadata linked to new variables
    - the gui can handle multiple categories for the Category metadata.
    - a new stylesheet has been used for the processing window.
    - in the processing window, for an algorithm, if an input is optional, a default message is added to the information window.


January 25 2016, Release version 0.6.0
======================================
  Two incompatibilites with the latest version of Numpy have been found in Nappy. Until the official fix, a modified nappy is proposed with EGADS.
  First version of the main GUI.
  
  ADDED:
    - a function to open netcdf files has been introduced, with all needed functions to feed the gui and close the file.
    - a function to save netcdf files to netcdf, NASA Ames and csv format has been introduced.
    - a function to read NASA Ames files has been introduced, with all needed functions to feed the gui and close the file.
    - it is now possible to save a NASA Ames file to netcdf file using the dedicated nappy API.
    - a list of variables is shown in the dedicated tab.
    - metadata (global and linked to variables) are now displayed in the GUI.
    - the status bar is fed with information (file name, file size, conventions)
    - it is now possible to modify the global metadata directly in the GUI.
    - it is now possible to modify the variable metadata directly in the GUI.
    - a new window to modify global metadata (accessible via an icon in the toolbar) has been added.
    - it is possible to add, modify and delete metadata through the new global metadata window.

  MODIFIED:
    - if a variable is selected, and a metadata has been modified before, it will now reflect the modification of the metadata even if another variable is selected.

    - the function to save netcdf also save the modified metadata.


December 1 2015 - 4 January 2016
================================
  First design of the new GUI dedicated to EGADS.
  EGADS version is currently 0.5.8. It appears to have critical issues with Nappy, as this one calls old numpy functions which have been discarded from newer versions.
